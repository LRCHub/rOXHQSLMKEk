Colder than ice, the world falls apart
Cold like a stone, the spell on the souls
Colder than ice, your hand on my heart
A world made of stone, let tenderness freeze
Save the fairyland we live in
Where all failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a Griffin
I fall down, straight down
Save the fairyland we live in
Where my failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a Griffin
I'm falling straight down
Catch my daydream
Catch my fall
Colder than ice, night all around
Cold like a stone, the heart of success
Wasteland of ice, we fall to the ground
A world made of stone, let tenderness freeze
Save the fairyland we live in
Where all failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a Griffin
I fall down, straight down
Save the fairyland we live in
Where my failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a Griffin
I'm falling straight down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, catch me
When I'm falling down
Please come to me
Save the fairyland we live in
Where all failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a Griffin
I fall down, straight down
Save the fairyland we live in
Where my failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a Griffin
I'm falling straight down
Catch my daydream
Catch my fall
